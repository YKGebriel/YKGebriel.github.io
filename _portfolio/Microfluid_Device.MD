## Microfluid Device Demo

## Device Description & Applications
Microfluid devices create a thorough and rapid mixing of multiple fluids samples on a microscopic level. The mixing of these samples is achieved by enhancing the diffusion between the flow samples. This microfluid device utilizes “passive” mixing schemes to increase the contact area and contact time of the fluid through purposefully designed microchannel pathways. These passive micromixers contain no motion in its parts and require no energy input other than the pressure head used to drive the fluid flows at a constant rate along the microfluid path.

Microfluidic mixing devices are utilized significantly in the biomedical field, specifically with diagnostics and drug developments. One prominent use of microfluidic devices in the biomedical field is the creation of immunoassays. These are used to detect analytes using antibodies. Immunoassays greatly benefit from microfluidic devices by minimizing fluid handling and minimizing washing steps. Additionally samples can be run into multiple microwells within the device, allowing one serum to be tested for multiple antibodies at once. They have seen great usage in the food and chemical industries as well. Microfluidics can also be applied to separating protein and DNA in techniques like capillary electrophoresis and liquid chromatography. Advantages of using microfluidics for these tasks include reduced time and cost and possible adding additional components to the microfluidic device to make the separation that much easier and precise.
