## Problem Description
The Tennessee Materials Marketplace needs to establish convenient and reliable partnerships between organizations to distributing waste materials for reuse or recycling rather than disposal. Creating these connections is especially important because there is no dedicated central storage space for materials. Pallets are one such material, and they are abundant and usually free on the Materials Marketplace listings. At the same time, college students need affordable, functional, and attractive furniture that is also easy to assemble and store because they want to maximize their quality of life while living in temporary and compact spaces with limited budgets. Could pallets be transformed from industrial uses to college dorm furniture to address both problems?

## Design Solution
Our team began the project by interviewing two people who work with the Materials Marketplace to understand their mission and challenges. We also gathered feedback from college students to learn about what qualities they would want for something they would build. We then brainstormed many solutions and narrowed down top concepts based on functional requirements and constraints derived from our interviews and research. We selected the shelf idea and explored two designs, finally choosing the modular crate concept pictured below. Students can assemble, customize, and stack these crates to suit their needs. They can be set on their side to be used as a shelf, or they can be used as a crate with the built in handles on two of the sides.
